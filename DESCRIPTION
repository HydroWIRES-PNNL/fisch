Description: Fisch is a hydropower scheduler that optimizes hourly releases within a week to 
    maximize hydropower revenue. Dynamic programming is used to identify the optimal release 
    schedule given hourly electricity prices, hourly inflow, and an end-of-week storage target 
    that parameterizes non-powered objectives and constraints.
