Description: fisch is a hydropower scheduler that optimizes hourly releases within a week to maximize
    hydropower revenue. Dynamic programing is used to identify the optimal release schedule given
    hourly electricity prices, hourly inflow, and an end-of-week storage target that parameterizes
    non-powered objectives and constraints.
